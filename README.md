# **My social network**
>
Hello! 
In this application I am creating my own social network with UI, BLL, DAL architecture. I used elements of the Lifecycle methods and hooks.

The published version of the project can be seen here: https://inna1996.github.io/inna1996-ReactRedux/


## General chat
>
All server users can write and receive messages.
I am using WEbSocket to connect a channel with a server


## Users
>
In this tab you can find any user (there is a search filtering function), make a subscription, and go to his profile


## Section "Dialogs"
>
Not finalized yet


## Log in and Authorization

Here you can log in to the network. If you enter the wrong code multiple times, captcha is released.

## Profile

Here you can visit your personal profile (only registered users) where personal data is changed such as avatar, status and others.
